							DAY 1: BASIC INTRODUCTION ON CLOUD

1) What is cloud computing ?

	On demand delivery of network access to provide shared pool of configurable computing resources(networking, compute,database,storage,servers,services,etc)

2) Cloud Models :

	1) IAAS -

		* Stands for Infrastructure as a Service 
		* Basic Building Block for a Cloud Infrastructure.
		* Example: AWS , Azure 
	2) PAAS -

		* Stands for Platform as a Service 
		* Removes the need for us to manage the underlying infrastructre
		* Provides an ondemand environment to code , test, deploy and managining our applications. 
		* Example: Jenkins,Cloud Beas
	3) SAAS -

		* Stands for Software as a Service 
		* Provides a product to completely run and managed by the service provider
		* Example: Dropbox, Wordpress, Google Drive, GitHub, Drupal and Salesforce  

3) Types of Cloud : 
	
	1) Public Cloud -
		
		* Anyone can use on demand and pay for the resources.
		* All the resources will be managed by the service providers like AWS,Azure,PVC,etc
		* Cost is less and provisioning of the resources will be managed by the user (means selection , deployment and runtime management of the hardwares 
		  and softwares)
	
	2) Private Cloud -
		
		* Everything will be managed by the user (hardware and software both)
		* Cost will be more as the infrastructure is on premise.
		* Also called as onpremise data center.
		* Security perspective this is high as it is on premise and everything is our responsibility.
	
	3) Community Cloud -
	
		* Different groups/communities come together to form their own cloud

	4) Hybrid Cloud -
	
		* Combination of the above mentioned clouds.
		* Example : VPC Peering between two clouds

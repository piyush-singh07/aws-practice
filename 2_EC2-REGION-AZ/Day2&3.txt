								DAY 2 & 3: REGIONS, AZs and EC2

REGIONS :

* It is actually a geographic region / seperate physical area.
* Example: Mumbai -> ap-south-1 , N.Virginia -> us-east-1 , us-east-2 , us-east-3
* Currently we have 24 regions (as of 10/09/2020) 

Best practice to chhose a region :

1) Proximity (Choose a region near to you so to have low latency)
2) Services (Some AWS services are specific to region except R53,S3 and IAM)
3) Cost 
4) SLA  (Service Level Agreement also depends upon to services specific to regions)
5) Compliance 

AVAILABILITY ZONE :

* These are actually the Physical Data centers which Amazon will never tell where it is located.
* AZs are seperated from each others and they belong to a specific region.
* Whenever any resource is created and provisioned in a Region then it is created in a Region actually in a AZ and the same thing is replicated and backed up
  so as to adhere to SLA.
* All the AZs are inter-connected with high bandwidth , low latency network over fully redundant , dedicated fiber providing high throughput , low latency 
  network between AZs.
* This is actually AWS managed service.
* Currently we have 77 AZs (as of 10/09/2020) 



EC2 :
 
* EC2 stands for Elastic Compute Cloud.
* It is a service which basically provides secure , resizable compute capacity in cloud.
* This is not just an EC2 instance , it is actually a service that provisions a computing environment with all the flavours of configuration.

Features of EC2:

* We can select a preconfigured tempelate which is nothing but AMI (Amazon's Machine Image) to get up and running .
* AMI basically provides information to launch an EC2.(A PRE CONFIGURED IMAGE)
* Configure security and access on Amazon EC2.
* Choose instance types and run , stop , start ,etc. 


EC2 PRICING :

1) Free Tier :

		* Includes 750 hours of free tier for linux and windows t2.micro instances each month for one year
		* To stay with the free tier we should use only t2.micro .

2) On-demand Instance :

		* Pay only for the running hour
		* Full control on you to start, stop , restart, hibernate,etc
		* Increase or decrease the compute capacity depending on demands.
		* Beneficial for application testing , web service testing or initial deployment of project for testing,etc
		* Basically on demand required .

3) Spot Instances :

		* An unused EC2 instance and its price is like 90% off the on demand price.
		* We can bid and get an instance to compute
		* users with urgent computing needs for the large amounts of additional capacity.

4) Reserved Instances:
	
		* Reserved Instances provide us with a significant discount upto 75% compared to on demand instamce pricing
		* Applications that have a steady state or predictable usage.
		* Applications that may require reserved capacity commit to 1-3 years term to reduce the total computing costs.

5) Reserved Host :
		
		* A dedicated host is a physical ec2 server dedicated for your use.
		* Can be purchased as a reservation for up to 70% off the ondemand price.
		* In this dedicated host we can spin and deploy as many as ec2 instances as per our need  and we will be charged only for the host not the 
		  instances 
		* The price of the dedicated host varies by instance family , region , and payment option.
		* You pay hourly for each active dedicated host , and you are not billed for the instance usage.

INSTANCE TYPES:

1) General Purpose --> Balance of compute , memory and networking capability
2) Compute Optimized --> high performance processes
3) Memory Optimised  --> to deliver fast performance for workloads that process large data sets in memory(high capacity RAM)
4) Accelerated Computing  --> uses harware accelerators or co-processors to perform functions such as floating points calculations , graphic processing and data pattern
			      matching , like more than possible in software running on CPUs (much GPU is used)
5) Storage Optimised --> designed for workloads that require high, sequential read and write access to very large data sets on local storage. (ssd for more iops for SAP HANA )

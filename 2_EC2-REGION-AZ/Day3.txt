								DAY 3: EC2

EC2 :
 
* EC2 stands for Elastic Compute Cloud.
* It is a service which basically provides secure , resizable compute capacity in cloud.
* This is not just an EC2 instance , it is actually a service that provisions a computing environment with all the flavours of configuration.

Features of EC2:

* We can select a preconfigured tempelate which is nothing but AMI (Amazon's Machine Image) to get up and running .
* AMI basically provides information to launch an EC2.(A PRE CONFIGURED IMAGE)
* Configure security and access on Amazon EC2.
* Choose instance types and run , stop , start ,etc. 


EC2 PRICING :

1) Free Tier :

		* Includes 750 hours of free tier for linux and windows t2.micro instances each month for one year
		* To stay with the free tier we should use only t2.micro .

2) On-demand Instance :

		* Pay only for the running hour
		* Full control on you to start, stop , restart, hibernate,etc
		* Increase or decrease the compute capacity depending on demands.
		* Beneficial for application testing , web service testing or initial deployment of project for testing,etc
		* Basically on demand required .

3) Spot Instances :

		* An unused EC2 instance and its price is like 90% off the on demand price.
		* We can bid and get an instance to compute
		* users with urgent computing needs for the large amounts of additional capacity.

4) Reserved Instances:
	
		* Reserved Instances provide us with a significant discount upto 75% compared to on demand instamce pricing
		* Applications that have a steady state or predictable usage.
		* Applications that may require reserved capacity commit to 1-3 years term to reduce the total computing costs.

5) Reserved Host :
		
		* A dedicated host is a physical ec2 server dedicated for your use.
		* Can be purchased as a reservation for up to 70% off the ondemand price.
		* In this dedicated host we can spin and deploy as many as ec2 instances as per our need  and we will be charged only for the host not the 
		  instances 
		* The price of the dedicated host varies by instance family , region , and payment option.
		* You pay hourly for each active dedicated host , and you are not billed for the instance usage.

INSTANCE TYPES:

1) General Purpose --> Balance of compute , memory and networking capability
2) Compute Optimized --> high performance processes
3) Memory Optimised  --> to deliver fast performance for workloads that process large data sets in memory(high capacity RAM)
4) Accelerated Computing  --> uses harware accelerators or co-processors to perform functions such as floating points calculations , graphic processing and data pattern
			      matching , like more than possible in software running on CPUs (much GPU is used)
5) Storage Optimised --> designed for workloads that require high, sequential read and write access to very large data sets on local storage. (ssd for more iops for SAP HANA )

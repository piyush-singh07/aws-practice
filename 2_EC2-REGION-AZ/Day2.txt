								DAY 2: REGIONS, AZs and EC2

REGIONS :

* It is actually a geographic region / seperate physical area.
* Example: Mumbai -> ap-south-1 , N.Virginia -> us-east-1 , us-east-2 , us-east-3
* Currently we have 24 regions (as of 10/09/2020) 

Best practice to chhose a region :

1) Proximity (Choose a region near to you so to have low latency)
2) Services (Some AWS services are specific to region except R53,S3 and IAM)
3) Cost 
4) SLA  (Service Level Agreement also depends upon to services specific to regions)
5) Compliance 

AVAILABILITY ZONE :

* These are actually the Physical Data centers which Amazon will never tell where it is located.
* AZs are seperated from each others and they belong to a specific region.
* Whenever any resource is created and provisioned in a Region then it is created in a Region actually in a AZ and the same thing is replicated and backed up
  so as to adhere to SLA.
* All the AZs are inter-connected with high bandwidth , low latency network over fully redundant , dedicated fiber providing high throughput , low latency 
  network between AZs.
* This is actually AWS managed service.
* Currently we have 77 AZs (as of 10/09/2020) 



EC2 :
 
* EC2 stands for Elastic Compute Cloud.
* It is a service which basically provides secure , resizable compute capacity in cloud.
* This is not just an EC2 instance , it is actually a service that provisions a computing environment with all the flavours of configuration.

Features of EC2:

* We can select a preconfigured tempelate which is nothing but AMI (Amazon's Machine Image) to get up and running .
* Configure security and access on Amazon EC2.
* Choose instance types and run , stop , start ,etc.

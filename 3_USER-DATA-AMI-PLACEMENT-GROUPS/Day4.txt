AWS SECURITY GROUPS:

1) For controlling the inbound and outbound traffic rules.
2) By default all the outbound rules are open for an EC2 instance and it can connect freely without any restriction unless and until we give any rule for the same
3) We specify the allow rules but not the deny rules
4) We set the rules and policies that to be allowed but not the one to be not allowed 
5) By default , there is no inbound rule for an EC2 means we cannot access the machine , we need to give the inbound rule for sure.

CONNECTION TRACKING :

Security Group uses connection tracking to track the information about the traffic to and from the instance.
Security Group name must be given unique for a VPC.

AMI:
